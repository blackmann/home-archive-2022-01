                <article>
                    <p>For so long I've been wanting to redo my homepage, this time with an easier blogging component.
I've tried to use <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next JS</a> with <a href="https://mdxjs.com">MDX</a> but the experience at the end of the day was going to feel more like coding, than writing [to me].
Other options included static site generators like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://hexo.io">Hexo</a>, etc.
But these solutions came with their troubles: overriding a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>Throughout this period, it felt like I had to learn these systems and then customize them [with configurations] per my preference.
That friction prevented the need to get through setting up my personal homepage.</p>
<p>About two weeks ago, I picked up <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust ðŸ¦€</a> because I began to grow some obsession for it.
I skimmed through the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust Book</a> and tried to compare it with other languages I know.
Syntax, semantics, thought process. I also picked up <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings"><em>Rust koans</em></a> (actually known as <code>rustlings</code>) and completed a few exercises.</p>
<h2>What happened</h2>
<p>Last weekend, despite my immature experience with Rust, I decided to build a tool that will help me generate my site from <code>.md</code> files.
I felt that would be <em>more lazier</em> and convenient than learning these existing site generators ðŸ˜‰.
So I laid out the process based on how I understood static generators (like Jekyll) worked.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/blackmann/d72a975aaae5e079e5ae339dfe20fcf0.js"></script>
<h4>Breakdown</h4>
<p><code>.initialize</code></p>
<p>In here I gather all the <code>.md</code> files from the <code>posts</code> directory then convert them into plain HTML string using <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak">comrak</a>. While parsing the markdown, I scan out the <code>front matter</code> which include necessary metadata that form a <code>Post</code>.
This method needs to be called first. The other methods can be called in any order.</p>
<p><code>.build_posts</code></p>
<p>The requirement for this method is to load a template (<code>HTML</code>) and then iterate through all the gathered posts [from <code>.initialize</code>], insert the parsed <code>.md</code> contents and output each post into separate HTML files.
Simple.
The <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> templating language is the perfect solution for defining our posts' template.
Liquid is just same old HTML but with super-powers. I only borrowed a few powers like <code>iteration</code> and <code>control flow</code>.
It allows us to also work variables that we can use in our template.</p>
<p><code>.build_home</code></p>
<p>This method uses the same idea as <code>.build_posts</code>. Which is, I load a home template (written in Liquid) and pass it the list of posts.
This list is used to prepare the <em>list</em> of blog posts on the home.</p>
<h2>Voila</h2>
<p>In these three easy steps, my <em>rip-off</em> works. There are only pros to this approach (of writing my own generator).</p>
<ul>
<li>I only spent about 8 hours (net time) on it. I think this is better than finding the correct configurations for a static site generator over days (gross).</li>
<li>I happened to learn a lot about Rust. More experience. <em>I'm now a <a href="https://twitter.com/__degreat">rustaman</a></em></li>
<li>I understand some intrinsics of a static site generator.</li>
</ul>
