# Motivation

The first time I saw synced lyrics was with the [Musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com) app.
That was many years ago. Even though the title says **Synced Lyrics from Apple 🍎**, I'm just [literally] finding out from the Musixmatch homepage that Apple uses their services.

But recently, I've been closer to Apple Music than with Musixmatch and I attribute the inspiration to the former.
